Cheat-sheet
======
I have a degree in Economics from the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco (2012) in Brazil. I also struggled to get a Master in Business Administration and Rural Development from the Rural Federal University of Pernambuco (2015) in Brazil. And I lost my sanity by pursuing a Phd degree in Economics from the University of Birmingham (2015 - present) with a scholarship from the Brazilian Education System (CAPES). I have experience in Economic Development, with emphasis in Environmental Economics, acting in the following areas: assessment and analysis of public policies, development and territorial analysis and econometric applications to environmental studies.
